Introduction
-----
Here you can find ready to use DOSBox emulator that works with Steam Runtime.

This can be used by game publishers to easily create packages of old DOS games that will run on SteamOS and Steam for Linux.


Usage
-----
Copy 'dosbox-*' and 'run.sh' to working directory (or simply clone the repository).
Copy DOS game files into subdirectory (example DOSGAME).
Create 'dosbox.conf' configuration file with settings optimized for the game.

The final structure should look similar to this
.
├── dosbox-32bit
│   ├── bin
│   │   └── dosbox
│   └── lib
│       └── ...
├── dosbox-64bit
│   ├── bin
│   │   └── dosbox
│   └── lib
│       └── ...
├── dosbox-source
│   └── ...
├── DOSGAME *
│   └── ...
├── dosbox.conf *
└── run.sh

Files and directories marked with '*' are created by you.


Technical details
-----
DOSBox binaries with requred libraries were extracted from official Ubuntu Precise packages on which the Steam Runtime is based on. Both 64-bit and 32-bit Linux is supported. The emulator is distributed under GPLv2 license which requires us to attach its sources. They are located in 'dosbox-source' directory along with applied patches.
